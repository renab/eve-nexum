/**
 * After a signature was edited or deleted, re-evaluate every connection that
 * touches `systemId` against the latest set of sigs on this system.
 *
 * For each such connection:
 *  - If any sig backs the link (whType + whLeadsTo, where whLeadsTo matches the
 *    other endpoint by class OR by name), fill / upgrade conn.type with the
 *    best non-K162 match.
 *  - If no sig backs it any more AND the previously-edited sig used to back
 *    it AND conn.type still matches that old whType, clear the connection
 *    back to `null` (so it's eligible for auto-fill again).
 *  - User-cleared connections (conn.type === '') and unrelated manual values
 *    are left alone.
 *
 * The `oldSig` argument is the sig's state BEFORE the edit/delete — it lets us
 * detect "this sig used to back this connection" so we don't accidentally
 * clear a value the user typed manually.
