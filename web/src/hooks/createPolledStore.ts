/**
 * Shared module-level cache for a single global resource that's refreshed on a
 * timer while anything is watching it. Replaces the hand-rolled "module cache +
 * Set of setState subscribers + setState() in a useEffect" pattern (which trips
 * react-hooks/set-state-in-effect and re-implements useSyncExternalStore badly).
 *
 * One fetch feeds every consumer; the poll starts on the first subscriber and
 * stops when the last unmounts. `equals` lets the store keep the previous
 * reference when a poll returns equivalent data, so consumers don't re-render.
 * `use(false)` (e.g. in share mode) opts out entirely — no subscription, no
 * poll, returns `empty`.
